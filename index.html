    On March 8, 1922 Ralph Baer was born in Rodalben, Germany. He faced persecution for being Jewish. In 1938, him and his family ran away to the United States, and became a naturalized citizen. Ralph enrolled in a radio technician course at the National Radio Institute. In 1943, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in military intelligence stationed overseas in France during WW2. After, he attended the American Television Institute of Technology. In 1949, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television Engineering. After he was commonly employed as an engineer. He lived in Manchester, New York, with his wife, Dena, who he married in 1952. Because of a reduction in TV prices he saw an opportunity for technology outside of normal television program viewing. So in 1966 Ralph convinced his supervisors at Sander to allow him to move forward with the idea. Then was able to develope the first commercial gaming unit, the "Brown Box Console." He went on to develope and patent several other hardware prototypes. This includes the pattern matching game Simon. Even after retirement he continued to innovate. He died on December 6, 2014 with 150 patents to his name
